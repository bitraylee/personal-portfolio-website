Hey there! Anshu this side, I'd like to present my personal porfolio website!
This was made as an  Assignment for WT lab-3,
I have showcased my interests and my hobbies in this website.
As instructed by my I was forbidden from using any JS throughout this project, everything in this website has been made in pure HTML and CSS.
Initially I had a plan to make this website fully responsive, but due to the time constraints and with no JS, made it really difficult.
